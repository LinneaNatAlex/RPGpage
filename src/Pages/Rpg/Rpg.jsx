            How Roleplay Works – The Great Hall RPG Guide Welcome to the magical
            world of Hogwarts! This is a text-based roleplaying game (RPG) where
            you take on the role of a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
            and Wizardry. For now, we use the live chat called The Great Hall as
            our shared space for all in-character roleplay.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>What is Roleplay (RPG)?</h2>
          <p>
            Roleplay means writing as your character — imagining how they think,
            feel, speak, and act in the world of Harry Potter. You’ll interact
            with other characters, build relationships, and create your own
            story, all through writing. Each player controls one or more
            original student characters (OCs), not canon characters like Harry
            or Hermione. You decide their name, house, personality, and history.
          </p>
          <h2>Where Do We Play?</h2>
          <p>
            For now, all main roleplay happens in the live chat room called The
            Great Hall. This is an open IC (in-character) space where all
            students can talk, meet, and play together in real time.
          </p>
          <h2>How to Roleplay in the Great Hall</h2>
          <strong>Always stay in-character </strong>You're a student at
          Hogwarts. Type your messages as if you're speaking or acting in the
          wizarding world. Example: Luna walks into the Great Hall, her scarf
          trailing behind her. "Did anyone else hear howling from the Forbidden
          Forest last night?"
          <br />
          <strong>Use simple action formatting</strong> You can describe actions
          using third person, past tense, like writing a story. Quotation marks
          are used for speech. Good: James sat down at the Gryffindor table and
          grinned. "I hope today’s breakfast has treacle tart." Avoid: "I sit
          down and say 'hello'" or *sits and waves*
          <br />
          <strong>Avoid OOC (Out-of-Character)</strong> talk in the Great Hall
          If you must say something as yourself, use double brackets like this:
          ((brb – dinner time)) But keep OOC talk to a minimum.
          <br />
          <strong>Respect the setting</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          1. The Great Hall is a large, be respectful and give others a chance
          to reply.
          <br /> 2. Don’t make your character too perfect or powerful. <br />
          3. Let scenes develop naturally – don’t try to control the whole
          story. <br /> 4. Read the mood of the room – if a serious scene is
          happening, don’t interrupt with silly actions. <br /> 5. What Not to
          Do No godmodding (controlling other characters without permission){" "}
          <br /> 6. No metagaming (using OOC knowledge IC) <br /> 7. No extreme
          violence, adult content, or disruptive behavior <br /> 8. No spamming
          or overly short one-liners like “walks in hi”
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Just Getting Started?</strong> Introduce your character in the
          chat by describing how they enter or join the conversation. You don’t
          need to wait for permission – just jump in. If you're unsure, watch
          how others write, or ask a mod for help ((in OOC brackets)).
